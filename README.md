# UI-UX-hackathon2
Hackathon hosted by Sindh Governor House.

My approach to solve this hackathon is as follows:

1> I first setted up my project with necessary folders which I would need to carry out this hackathon.

2> Then, I downloaded all the necessary pictures which I needed from Figma.

3> I started working on easy and complete things first. Such as, header and footer.

4> Finally, I started working on main content of this hackathon which was home page.

5> Lastly, I made header & footer responsive. I was aiming to make main page responsive as well but unfortunately time was too short and I was also already very tired of working from early morning.

I've learnt a lot of things from this hackathon (including NextJS DOM concepts) and when to use which CSS framework (such as Tailwind CSS). I also learnt installing fonts which would show on deployment of website as well. In conclusion, I enjoyed this hackathon for learning.
